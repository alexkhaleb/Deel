I uploaded 4 test cases, they were written in Selenium. This cases can be imported to any GhostInspector account and run it.

The LOGIN test file is the Entry file to login with my credentials.
The Assert test file is a validation test to be sure that all the elements are correct in the site.
The Exception test file is done by sending empty fields except the date. In here we validate all the exception red fields. - Negative Registry
The Complete Registry is the Happy Path file in order to perform a Registry with my account, with my data and my information. - Positive Registry.
